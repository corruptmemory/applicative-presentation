# Applicative functors

These are the presentation materials for the [NY Functional Programmers Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/lisp-59/events/37308592/) on October 25, 2011.

# Examples

In the `examples` folder you'll find a really simple set of examples used in the presentation.  There is a `cabal` file and the project was built using GHC 7.0.2.

I _swear_ I didn't lie about any of the code in the presentation, you can try it all out for yourself. ;-)
